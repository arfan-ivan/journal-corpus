      "title": "Reframing food addiction in childhood obesity: Cultural relevance and digital innovation needed.",
      "abstract": "This letter responds to the article by An et al. on the link between food addiction and emotional and behavioral problems in children with obesity. We highlight two key points. First, most research on food addiction comes from Western countries, yet childhood obesity is rising quickly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), especially in Southeast Asia. Cultural differences in food habits, family roles, and emotional expression may affect how food addiction appears and should be studied. Second, tools like the Yale Food Addiction Scale for Children (YFAS-C) must be carefully adapted and validated for different cultures-not just translated. We also suggest using digital tools, like apps and games, to support treatment, but these should be designed ethically and tested properly. We call for global research partnerships and culturally sensitive approaches to better understand and address food addiction in children worldwide.",

      "title": "The role of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) in improving paper strength from rice straw pulp.",
      "abstract": "Rice straw, an abundant agricultural byproduct, is rich in lignocellulosic materials, making it a viable source for pulp production in paper bags and packaging applications. This investigation evaluated the properties of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) derived from rice straw and its influence on the paper's mechanical strength. Cellulose was extracted using a soda pulping process, followed by bleaching. The resultant cellulose was hydrolyzed with 1 M HCl and ground to achieve the desired form of MCC. The study established that the MCC concentration in distilled water stabilized at 0.4 % (w/v) with a zeta potential measuring -42.6 mV, indicating good dispersion stability. Morphological examinations revealed significant alterations in fiber structure, and FTIR confirmed changes in functional groups during both the pulping process and the final MCC production. Enhanced crystallinity and improved thermal properties were also noted, suggesting a more thermally stable product. Furthermore, incorporating MCC into the paper matrix led to notable enhancements in mechanical properties. The addition of MCC at concentrations of 50 % and 75 % markedly increased the tensile and tear indices of the paper. However, a decrease in the burst index was observed when MCC content exceeded 75 %.",

      "abstract": "Red fruit (Pandanus conoideus L.) oil contains high antioxidants to prevent oxidative stress in broilers. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of dietary supplementation with red fruit extract on productivity, blood biochemicals, intestinal histomorphology, carcass characteristics, meat quality, and antioxidant gene expression in broilers. A total of 280 Indian River day-old-chick broilers were divided into 4 treatments: basal feed with the addition of 0 (CTRL), 0.15 % (RFO-SCa15), 0.30 % (RFO-SCa30), and 0.45 % (RFO-SCa45) red fruit oil calcium saponification. Each treatment consisted of 7 replicates with 10 birds per replicate. The results showed that the red fruit oil supplementation had no effect on FI, BW, BWG, and FCR during the grower phase (P>0.05). However, the addition of 0.45 % red fruit extract increased FCR and decreased index performance (IP) in the finisher phase (P<0.05). Red fruit oil did not influence the dry matter (DM), ash content (AC), crude protein (CP), extract eter (EE), and lactic acid content of meat (P > 0.05). Conversely, the addition of red fruit extract significantly reduced 1,1-diphenyl-2-pikrilhidrazil (DPPH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in meat (P<0.05), although no significant difference was found between RFO-SCa15 and CTRL for DPPH. The yellowness (b*) value of meat was higher in the RFO-SCa30 and RFO-SCa45 groups compared to the CTRL group (P<0.01), while no differences were observed in pH, lightness (L), redness (a*), cooking loss, and tenderness (P>0.05). Furthermore, red fruit oil upregulated the expression of antioxidant-related genes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) (P<0.05). In conclusion, dietary supplementation with 0.30 % red fruit oil calcium saponification improved the potential of meat quality and reduced oxidative stress markers without affecting broiler productivity. These findings highlight the potential red fruit oil as a natural antioxidant in broiler diets.",

      "title": "Drivers and barriers of eco-innovation in electric vehicle diffusion: Evidence from Indonesia.",
      "abstract": "Electric vehicles (EVs) are critical to achieving global decarbonization targets, yet their adoption in emerging economies remains limited. Indonesia is an emerging economy in Southeast Asia with a vehicle population of more than 164 million. However, public interest in adopting EVs remains low, with only 322,325. This study explores the drivers and barriers of eco-innovation (EI) in EV diffusion in Indonesia through qualitative interviews with 61 stakeholders, including energy companies, automotive manufacturers, and infrastructure providers. The findings highlight that fiscal and non-fiscal incentives, such as subsidies and tax exemptions, have encouraged EV adoption but suffer from inconsistent implementation. Collaboration among manufacturers, green suppliers, and research institutions emerges as key drivers, fostering technological innovation through knowledge spillovers. Early adopters, including urban users and ride-hailing services, demonstrate the importance of green market sensing in shaping demand. Major barriers include limited charging infrastructure, high upfront costs, and low public awareness. Additionally, we find that circular economic practices, such as battery recycling and repurpose energy storage, offer sustainability benefits but require stronger policy support. This research extends eco-innovation and innovation diffusion theories by contextualizing them for emerging economies, addressing socio-economic and regulatory barriers. We conclude by providing insights for policymakers and industry leaders.",

      "title": "The biogeochemistry of dissolved amino acids in the aquatic ecosystems.",
      "abstract": "Marine environments host diverse organisms, each playing a crucial role in various ecological processes. Dissolved free amino acids (DFAAs) represent a key constitutes of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in marine environments. They function as readily available substrates for microorganisms, supporting primary production and facilitating trophic interactions by supplying essential nitrogen and carbon sources. Their rapid turnover links DOM processing with nutrient dynamics and global biogeochemical cycles. This review synthesizes current insights into the sources, distribution, dynamics and ecological roles of DFAAs, emphasizing their significance as crucial components in biochemical pathways in the marine environment, including their significance in biogeochemical cycles, nutrient availability, and responses to environmental changes. We also discuss analytical advances that enable detection of DFAAs at low concentrations in complex seawater matrices. Finally, we highlight how DFAA concentrations can serve as sensitive indicators of environmental shifts, underscoring their importance for monitoring ecosystem health and informing marine conservation strategies. By investigating DFAA dynamics, researchers can gain insights into the intricate processes that govern marine ecosystems and contribute to the conservation and sustainable management of our oceans. Overall, this review paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current knowledge on DFAAs in the marine environment.",

      "title": "Meaning of life as a protective factor against early mortality: Implications for life expectancy.",
      "abstract": "Research by Sutin et al. [16] shows a significant relationship between the meaning of life and reduced risk of mortality from various causes, including cancer, respiratory diseases, and COVID-19. Based on data from the UK Biobank, individuals with higher levels of meaning in life have a 15 % lower risk of death, even after accounting for social-demographic factors, clinical conditions, and health behaviors. Interestingly, this relationship remains strong even in the presence of depression, suggesting that meaning in life offers benefits to individuals with psychological disorders. It would be interesting and important to explore whether the findings of Sutin and colleagues can be translated into the Asian context, particularly in Indonesia. In Indonesia, deep-rooted religious and social values, such as mutual cooperation (gotong royong) and family ties, play a crucial role in shaping the meaning of life. In the broader Asian context, the meaning of life is influenced by spiritual teachings and cultural values, such as Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism. These teachings emphasize the importance of a life purpose connected to wisdom, inner peace, and social harmony. Integrating the concept of the meaning of life into public health policies in Indonesia and other ASEAN countries could be an effective approach to reducing early mortality and increasing life expectancy. In the face of rapid population aging in the region, meaning of life can help improve psychological and physical well-being, reduce stress, and extend longevity. Therefore, considering the meaning of life as part of public health strategies could enhance life quality and strengthen the social and psychological resilience of the community.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia involves aberrant connectivity of anatomical and functional networks. However, it is currently unclear whether such disruptions are present in clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR-P) participants and whether there may be an overlap between structural and functional connectivity alterations. We obtained diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) and resting-state, magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) data from N = 110 CHR-P participants and N = 49 healthy controls (HC). A network analysis approach was employed to explore differences in dMRI and rsfMRI connectivity as well as potential overlap between both modalities. In addition, correlations between dMRI and rsfMRI-data, clinical and neurocognitive variables as well as with clinical outcomes were investigated. We observed hyper- and hypoconnectivity across occipital, parietal, temporal, and frontal cortices in both dMRI and rsfMRI-data in CHR-Ps. Moreover, dMRI- and rsfMRI-defined overlapping nodes that differed between CHR-Ps vs. HC overlapped with visual networks, right ventral attention network, and right default mode network. Correlational analyses indicated significant relationships between the severity of CHR-P symptoms, cognitive deficits, and dMRI/rsfMRI-defined hypo- and hyper-connectivity. Finally, CHR-P individuals with persistent attenuated psychotic symptoms (APS) were characterised by aberrant dMRI and rsfMRI connectivity compared to non-persistent APS. Our study shows subtle but widespread disruptions in dMRI and rsfMRI connectivity in CHR-P participants. Specifically, we identified several occipital, parietal, temporal, and frontal regions that were characterised by hyper and hypoconnectivity which correlated with the severity of clinical symptoms and cognitive impairments. Moreover, our findings suggest that dMRI and rsfMRI connectivity measures could serve as a potential biomarker for clinical outcomes in CHR-Ps.",

      "abstract": "Building Information Modeling (BIM) has become integral to modern construction management in China, yet its successful implementation has been hindered by a shortage of skilled BIM personnel and high turnover rates. This study investigates the key factors influencing turnover intention among BIM workers in China through a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. Survey data were collected from 558 BIM practitioners and researchers across various regions in China. The SEM results revealed that three work-related factors-management and staff cooperation, working hours, and satisfaction with salary and incentives-significantly affected BIM workers' turnover intentions. Notably, the influence of these factors on turnover intention was fully mediated by two pivotal attitudinal variables: job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Among the predictors, excessive working hours emerged as the most salient driver heightening turnover intention, whereas strong team cooperation and competitive, fair rewards reduce the propensity to leave by enhancing worker satisfaction and commitment. The integrated model developed in this research advances understanding of BIM workforce retention and can be generalized to similar project-based contexts. The findings provide an evidence-based foundation for policymakers and industry leaders to devise strategies (e.g., improving working conditions, strengthening organizational support) aimed at increasing job satisfaction and commitment, thereby mitigating turnover intention among BIM workers.",

      "title": "The Impact of Fermented Milk Products on Gut Microbiota-Derived Metabolites in Obesity: A Narrative Review.",
      "abstract": "Obesity, a multifactorial metabolic disorder, has been increasingly linked to gut microbiota dysbiosis and its downstream metabolites. Among these, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and secondary bile acids (SBAs) play pivotal roles in energy regulation, glucose and lipid metabolism, inflammation, and host-microbiota crosstalk. Fermented milk products, enriched with probiotics, prebiotics, and bioactive peptides, offer a dietary intervention capable of modulating the gut microbial community and promoting the production of beneficial metabolites. This narrative review synthesizes evidence from both animal and human studies to explore the influence of fermented milk products on SCFA and SBA production in the context of obesity. Findings suggest that fermented milk consumption enhances the abundance of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium), increases SCFA and SBA levels, improves intestinal barrier function, and contributes to improved metabolic outcomes, including reduced inflammation, improved insulin sensitivity, and favorable lipid profiles. These effects are mediated through key molecular pathways involving free fatty acid receptors, bile acid receptors, and inflammatory mediators. Further long-term, mechanistic, and population-diverse studies are essential to optimize formulations and substantiate clinical applications of fermented milk in obesity management.",

      "abstract": "Soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) is a critical crop for food security and economic development in tropical regions, particularly in Indonesia. Despite its importance, the productivity of soybean in these areas is hindered by challenging climatic conditions, leading to a reliance on imports from temperate regions. Here, we identify genotypes that exhibit superior agronomic traits and stability, thereby contributing to improved soybean productivity in tropical environments. The multi-trait genotype-ideotype distance index (MGIDI) and multi-trait stability index (MTSI) were employed to evaluate the genotypes' performance in relation to an ideal ideotype and their stability across the environments. Additionally, the Genotype Main Effect Plus G × E Interaction (GGE) Biplot analysis was utilised to examine genotype-by-environment interactions and to identify the most suitable environments for soybean cultivation. The MGIDI index analysis identified the 100-seed weight (W100) as a key trait with the highest selection gain. The MTSI identified genotypes G11, G18 and G14 as the most stable across all environments. The GGE Biplot analysis indicated E2 (Upland, rainy season) as the most ideal environment for selecting superior soybean genotypes, suggesting it is the optimal setting for future breeding efforts. This study highlighted the importance of multi-trait selection and stability analysis in identifying soybean genotypes with both desirable traits and environmental stability for diverse tropical conditions. These findings offer strategic insights for future soybean breeding and cultivation in tropical regions.",

The Asia-Pacific Vaccine Research Network is a collaborative platform that aims to address common challenges faced by Asia-Pacific LMICs in undertaking vaccine research and barriers to evidence-based immunisation policy and practice. A network workshop was held in 2023 that aimed to identify critical challenges and opportunities to advance vaccine research to inform immunisation policy in LMICs in the Asia-Pacific. We found common themes to be challenges and opportunities in vaccine research capacity and infrastructure, workforce availability, financing and regulatory issues. To help to address some of these common challenges across the region, the Asia-Pacific Vaccine Research Network aims to facilitate the upskilling of vaccine research capability and knowledge exchange by bringing together experts and stakeholders from diverse backgrounds and through collaboration.",

Relying solely on sensory evaluation to describe the complex flavors of different cacao genotypes is insufficient because of the reliance on human expertise and the need for robust validation. This study aimed to enhance the understanding of flavor quality in different cacao genotypes by investigating the correlation between sensory attributes and metabolite profiles using metabolomics-based approach and sensory analysis. Cacao genotypes can be categorized based on their sensory attributes and metabolite profiles. The ICCRI09-genotype exhibited outstanding flavors, which were significantly associated with non-volatile and volatile compounds (e.g. Organic acids, some sugars, 3-methylbutanal, 2,3-butanediol, benzaldehyde, linalool, trans-linalool oxide, isobutyl acetate, etc.) (",

A meta-analysis of minimally invasive surgery in intracranial hemorrhage patients has been carried out previously and resulted in an improved prognosis. However, the efficacy and safety of minimally invasive surgery procedures remain subjects of debate. A comprehensive search was conducted in major databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Sage, Taylor and Francis, and Preprints in August 2024. From the search results, 2798 articles were obtained and then selected into ten articles. A risk ratio analysis was performed to compare the prognosis of minimally invasive surgery with conventional procedures. Risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals for minimally invasive surgery compared with conventional procedures in clinical trials and observational studies were 0.68 [0.55-0.84] and 0.57 [0.46-0.71], respectively. This meta-analysis also demonstrated that there was a significant reduction in the risk of death and the length of hospital stay in minimally invasive surgery patients. Nevertheless, there was no difference in the risk of rebleeding when compared with conventional procedures in patients with hemorrhagic stroke localized to the thalamus.",

      "title": "End-Expiratory Lung Impedance as a Tool for PEEP Optimization in Patients with Intra-Abdominal Hypertension: A Laparoscopic Surgery Model.",
      "abstract": "Increased intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) that is frequently found on patients requiring mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU) can disrupt splanchnic perfusion and ventilation management. Elevated IAP, resulting from various factors including hemorrhage or abdominal masses, can lead to multi-organ dysfunction if not managed effectively. Interestingly, IAP is also prevalent in healthy individuals undergoing laparoscopic surgery, making it a valuable model for studying ventilation strategies applicable to critically ill patients. This study investigates the effects of varying positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels on end-expiratory lung impedance (EELI) during laparoscopic procedures, hypothesizing that alterations in PEEP can significantly influence EELI, particularly in dependent lung regions. Conducted at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, this prospective cohort study included adult patients without severe pulmonary or cardiovascular conditions, assessing EELI through electrical impedance tomography (EIT). EIT was used to assess global and regional EELI changes at PEEP levels of 5, 8 11 and 14 cmH2O following CO2 insufflation. The findings indicated that insufflation raised global EELI (∆EELI-G) following PEEP adjustments, which contradicts expectations from increased IAP. Regional analysis highlighted that dependent lung areas exhibited more significant changes, suggesting a complex relationship between PEEP and lung mechanics during elevated IAP. Despite no adverse respiratory complications observed, obesity notably influenced EELI post-anesthesia, underscoring the necessity for tailored PEEP strategies to enhance pulmonary function in at-risk populations. This study advances understanding of optimal ventilatory management in patients with altered IAP and calls for further investigation into individualized PEEP applications and the exploration of advanced imaging modalities for lung assessment.",

      "title": "Assessing the role of short-sea shipping and ports in maritime well-to-wake emissions.",
      "abstract": "Analysing the carbon footprint of short-sea shipping and ports within the context of total end-to-end maritime emissions is important to help understand both their relative contributions and how they can be reduced. Focusing on the container mode, this study develops a bottom-up, well-to-wake/wheel (WtW) model to comprehensively assess the carbon footprint of short-sea shipping and port operations. This paper utilised two contrasting short-sea container shipping case studies: Tyne - Rotterdam (Europe) and Semarang - Singapore (Asia). In Case Study 1 (Europe), with an average roundtrip distance of 694 nautical miles (NM), total emissions were distributed: shipping at-sea 47.3%, shipping in-port at 32.7% and port operations at 20%. In Case Study 2 (Asia), with a longer average roundtrip distance of 1,849 NM, total emissions were distributed: shipping at-sea 70.1%, shipping in-port at 18%, and port operations at 11.9%. These findings highlight that the port operations emissions share is higher in shorter shipping corridors. The predominance of shipping emissions in both corridors suggests ports could have more impact on enabling short-sea shipping decarbonisation by supporting alternative fuels and promoting operational strategies such as virtual arrival. The proposed model is especially valuable for ports, where standardised methods for estimating their emissions remain limited.",

      "abstract": "Early information concerning water, oil, and free fatty acid (FFA) content in palm fruit on-site is crucial in determining the commercial value of fresh fruit bunches (FFB) and maintaining oil palm quality. Conventional methods are destructive, labor-intensive, single-target, costly, and time-consuming. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a method for the multi-parameter prediction of oil palm fruit quality using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) were implemented as a novel chemometric method. A total of 750 fruit samples of the Tenera variety (Elaeis guineensis Jacq. var. tenera) with various maturity levels were collected from the Cikabayan Oil Palm Plantation. Each sample was scanned using an NIR instrument at 1000-1500 nm wavelengths to obtain absorbance data. The EWT was applied to decompose the NIR spectra into empirical modes, and GPR was used to build a regression model for fitting. Based on numerical analysis, the combination of EWT and GPR produced the root mean square error (RMSE) values of 2.877 ± 0.900 % (R",

      "abstract": "Infants experience significant changes in gut microbiota during the first year of life as they transition from exclusive milk consumption to solid foods. The purpose of this study is to explore how dietary changes in infancy influence gut microbiota composition and diversity. A scoping review was conducted using databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Ovid Medline, Science Direct, and ProQuest. English-language studies published between 2003 and 2023 were included if they focused on mothers and caregivers with children aged 0 to 23 months involved in Infant and Young Child Feeding practices. A total of 561 studies were identified, with 15 articles included for data extraction. Significant differences in gut microbiota diversity related to feeding practices were observed. Infants who were exclusively breastfeding (EBF) exhibited lower phylogenetic diversity (5.8 ± 1.3, P < 0.05) compared to non-EBF infants (6.4 ± 1.8, P < 0.05). The EBF infants showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher levels of beneficial bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium, while non-EBF infants had elevated levels of potentially pathogenic genera, including Bacteroides and Clostridium. Additionally, earlier introduction of complementary foods was associated with increased alpha diversity (mean difference = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.25, 0.55), and dietary factors such as total energy intake, carbohydrate, and fiber significantly correlated with gut microbial diversity (P < 0.05). These results imply that the type of feeding, timing of introduction, and type of food intake during complementary feeding have a significant impact on the infant's gut microbiota diversity and composition. Future research could explore the long-term implications of these early dietary exposures on metabolic function and immune system health.",

We assembled a multi-taxa tracking dataset (11 million geopositions from 15,845 tracked individuals across 121 species) to provide a global assessment of space use of highly mobile marine megafauna, showing that 63% of the area that they cover is used 80% of the time as important migratory corridors or residence areas. The GBF 30% threshold (Target 3) will be insufficient for marine megafauna's effective conservation, leaving important areas exposed to major anthropogenic threats. Coupling area protection with mitigation strategies (e.g., fishing regulation, wildlife-traffic separation) will be essential to reach international goals and conserve biodiversity.",

The direction of this research is the production of guiding data for roadmaps for strengthening the capacity of volunteers as the spearhead of disaster risk reduction. The purpose of the study was to find out how the volunteers' helping behaviour provides post-disaster psychosocial support. Two kinds of studies (multimethod) were conducted to answer the research questions. Study 1 was conducted on three volunteer participants, using the phenomenological method. Analysis of research data using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Study 2 was conducted on 69 volunteer respondents, using a survey method with open-ended questions to determine respondents' perceptions of the meaning of helping and the meaning of psychosocial support. The results of data integration found five themes in helping behaviour which included the values of volunteers and their goals, motivation and attitudes in helping, cooperation with other parties, as well as special themes/other findings in the form of mottos owned by volunteers.",

      "title": "Effect of Prophylactic Intraoperative Tranexamic Acid on Postpartum Blood Loss Following Cesarean Section at a Single Center.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Postpartum blood loss after cesarean section can be challenging to control, resulting in maternal morbidity and mortality. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a synthetic reversible plasminogen inhibitor that is approved for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding, but off-label use has been described, including for the control of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). This study aimed to compare postpartum blood loss after cesarean section in women treated with either tranexamic acid or placebo. MATERIAL AND METHODS This single-center clinical study conducted in Indonesia enrolled 88 women undergoing cesarean section. Participants were randomized into 2 groups: the treatment group (n=44) received 1 g of TXA intravenously at the time of surgical incision, and the placebo group (n=44) received 10 ml of saline. Blood loss was measured using a calibrated surgical suction device and pictogram, with total blood loss calculated by subtracting amniotic and irrigation fluids. RESULTS PPH occurred in 10.2% of all patients. Group A had significantly less blood loss than group B (mean=459.4 ml vs 686.3 ml; P<0.001). TXA was significantly protective, reducing the risk of PPH by 87.5% compared to group B (RR=0.125 [95% CI 0.016-0.958]; P=0.045). There were no significant differences in adverse effects between the 2 groups (P=0.101). CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative TXA administration significantly reduces blood loss and the risk of PPH in women undergoing cesarean sections. These findings support the routine use of TXA in cesarean management protocols to improve maternal safety and outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the sources and fate of antibiotics from livestock, humans, and aquaculture, as well as their transport via rivers to reservoirs, is crucial to design effective management strategies to mitigate associated risks. This study investigates the sources, fate, and transport of antibiotic residues in the river-reservoir system to inform strategies for mitigating their ecological impacts on water-related ecosystem. The MARINA-antibiotics (China-1.0) model (Model to Assess River Inputs of Pollutants to Seas for Antibiotics in freshwater) was adjusted for the Cirata Reservoir catchment in Indonesia and potential antibiotic pollution from aquaculture was incorporated into the model. Using this adjusted model, the inputs of 14 antibiotics from human use, livestock farming, and aquaculture were quantified. Seasonal trends revealed higher antibiotic loads during the wet season, predominantly from human sources, livestock, and aquaculture, with point sources as the largest sources. The primary contributors were livestock farming, particularly sheep, cattle, and broiler farming. Antibiotic residues were detected at higher concentrations in the river than in the reservoir, highlighting the river's critical role in transporting antibiotics from subbasins to the reservoir. Relevant fate processes for some antibiotic classes included, degradation in soil, and for others minimal sedimentation before they entered the reservoir and continued degradation afterwards. Antibiotic degradation varied by antibiotic class and hydrological conditions. Model validation showed that 80 % of antibiotic residues concentration in the reservoir fell within the observed range. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the model was sensitive to human and livestock populations, antibiotic consumption rates, manure management practices, and hydrological characteristics. This study provides the first assessment of antibiotic sources and dynamics in an Indonesian river-reservoir system, offering key insights to support strategies for reducing the impact of antibiotic residues on water-related ecosystems.",

      "title": "Analysis of genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships among Indonesian native cattle breeds using microsatellite markers: A review.",
      "abstract": "Indonesia is home to a diverse array of native cattle breeds - such as Aceh, Bali, Madura, and Sumba Ongole - that are uniquely adapted to their regional environments and integral to the country's agricultural and cultural heritage. This review synthesizes current research on the genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships of Indonesian native cattle using microsatellite markers, a robust molecular tool for assessing genetic variation. Analysis of multiple studies reveals that geographical isolation, selective breeding, and human-mediated practices have shaped the genetic structure of these populations. Notably, Bali and Madura cattle exhibit distinctive genetic clusters reflecting island isolation and long-standing breeding traditions. Findings also underscore concerns regarding genetic erosion caused by uncontrolled crossbreeding with exotic breeds, which threatens local adaptability and increases the risk of inbreeding. Key genetic parameters - including allele richness, heterozygosity, and inbreeding coefficients - suggest varying degrees of genetic integrity among the breeds, with several populations showing signs of inbreeding depression. Microsatellite data further demonstrate clear phylogenetic separation among breeds, offering valuable insights for breed identification and conservation planning. The primary strength of this review lies in its comprehensive integration of genetic studies across diverse breeds and islands, providing a national-scale perspective. However, limitations include the underrepresentation of certain breeds and reliance on microsatellite data without integration of high-resolution genomic tools. Future research should incorporate advanced molecular techniques e.g., sngle-nucleotide polymorphism arrays and whole-genome sequencing) and longitudinal monitoring to inform targeted conservation strategies. This review advocates for the incorporation of molecular genetic data into national breeding and conservation programs. Strengthening such initiatives is essential for preserving Indonesia's indigenous cattle as valuable genetic resources for climate-resilient, sustainable livestock production.",

While brief cognitive batteries have become popular for their practicality, most have been developed in high-income countries, neglecting the diverse educational backgrounds found in developing nations.This study focuses on the Brief Cognitive Screening Battery (BCSB) adapted for Indonesia (BCSB-INA), aiming to investigate its diagnostic accuracy in detecting cognitive impairment among older adults.This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Memory Clinic of Universitas Sumatera Utara Hospital from January to August 2024, including participants aged 50 and above. Subjects underwent cognitive assessments using MoCA-INA and BCSB-INA. Data analysis involved ROC curves to evaluate the tests' accuracy.A total of 140 subjects were included, with significant differences in cognitive test scores between those with cognitive impairment and normal individuals. The BCSB-INA demonstrated good diagnostic performance, with an AUC of 0.875 when including the Clock Drawing Test (CDT) and 0.810 without it. The development of a multivariate model further enhances its diagnostic capabilities, allowing for more tailored intervention strategies.The BCSB-INA represents an important improvement in cognitive assessment for older adults in Indonesia, showing good sensitivity and specificity. Continued research and updates to cognitive assessment tools are crucial to meet the increasing demand for effective dementia screening in diverse populations.",

      "abstract": "An outbreak of zoonotic diseases is one of the worldwide threats. Bats were reported as important reservoir hosts for many emerging zoonotic diseases. To mitigate the risk, understanding bat virome and their distribution is indispensable. Universal detection methods that can simultaneously identify multiple viruses are some of the most promising approaches. Here, we developed a semicomprehensive detection method integrating group-wide RT-PCR for paramyxoviruses and multiplex next-generation sequencing. The RT-PCR consists of three sets of degenerative primers covering viruses from Paramyxoviridae, including Pneumoviridae, which have now been reclassified into a distinct family. Index nucleotides were added to the primers to enable cost-effective multiplex sequencing, and the length of index was optimized to increase sensitivity. The method was applied to tracheal and rectal swabs from 135 bats captured in Indonesia. A conventional RT-PCR test validated the NGS results. Collectively, seven sequences of novel paramyxovirus-like similar to Pararubulavirus, Orthorubulavirus, and Henipavirus were successfully identified from seven bat samples. Furthermore, sequences between the two different target locations detected by NGS in the virus genomes were verified by RT-PCR. The similarity of the obtained sequences to the known paramyxoviruses sequences was relatively low, ranging from 70.88 to 82.44%. It suggests that the obtained sequences from novel viruses and the zoonotic risk of those novel viruses remain unknown. This cost-affordable, semi-comprehensive, pan-paramyxovirus test can be applied to other samples for viral genome surveillance, and the same strategy can be implemented to other pathogens for zoonosis control.",

      "title": "Cost-efficiency of mastitis control strategies on smallholder dairy farms.",
      "abstract": "Mastitis poses significant challenges to the global dairy industry, including smallholder farms, which contribute substantially to global milk production. In Indonesia, where smallholder farming is vital to the dairy sector, mastitis represents a substantial obstacle to sustainable milk production and farm profitability. The objectives of this study were to estimate the costs associated with mastitis on Indonesian smallholder dairy farms and evaluate the cost-efficiency of various mastitis control strategies. A stochastic Monte Carlo bio-economic simulation model was employed to mimic mastitis dynamics and to estimate the economic effect on a typical Indonesian dairy farm of 4 cows. Input parameter values were gathered from various sources including literature, fieldwork data collection, local research reports, and expert insights obtained from staff of a local cooperative, veterinarians, local university experts, and authors' expertise. Somatic cell count values were added to the model to monitor udder health and milk quality per time period of 2 wk. Blanket dry cow therapy was also included to refine mastitis dynamics. All simulation outcomes were aggregated per year and per farm. Results indicated that clinical and subclinical mastitis incurred costs of €101.98 and €73.22 per farm per year, respectively. Clinical mastitis costs were primarily driven by culling (45%) and discarded milk (27%), whereas subclinical mastitis costs were shared between production loss (52%) and blanket dry cow therapy (48%). Five mastitis control strategies were evaluated, including postmilking teat disinfection, a higher manure removal frequency, washing udders with soap, udder health monitoring using the California Mastitis Test (CMT), and antibiotic treatment for subclinical mastitis. Among these, postmilking teat disinfection emerged as the only strategy with a positive net economic benefit, significantly reducing mastitis incidence and associated economic losses. This study further suggests that the cost-efficiency of udder health monitoring using the CMT and antibiotic treatment for subclinical mastitis depends on substantially reducing mastitis incidence. This finding highlights the need for farmers to combine with other cost-efficient control strategies, rather than relying solely on CMT and treatment strategy. Farmers, therefore, need to adopt strategies to lower the incidence rates of clinical and subclinical mastitis, thereby offsetting the costs when applying these strategies. In conclusion, the study emphasizes the economic burden of mastitis on smallholder dairy farms and the critical need for efficient control strategies to support improving the profitability and sustainability of smallholder dairy farms.",

To assess and support the development of such attitudes, a brief, valid, and reliable tool is needed in Indonesia. However, no such tool is currently available in Indonesia. The Approaches to Dementia Questionnaire (ADQ) is a well-established instrument that measures care staff attitudes and has been shown to predict staff behaviour and the recognition of people with dementia.

The work of nurses, key users of information and information systems, is changing, and nurses must be digitally literate, possessing skills to influence the design, development, and implementation of digital systems. Indonesia is a geographically diverse country and witnessing increasing digital health capability. To establish baseline knowledge, this review explored what is currently about digital health in Indonesian nursing and how prepared nurses are for increasing digitalization and its impacts. A scoping review was undertaken with five databases searched. No date range was applied. Twenty-two studies were included, 72.7% were published after 2020, and 68.2% were conducted on the island of Java. From content analysis, three categories were identified: (1) nurses' readiness for digital health; (2) supporting specific healthcare needs; and (3) health information systems. Varied levels of readiness of nurses for digital health were reported. Nurses engaged in mobile application development to support patients with specific clinical conditions in the community and development and implementation of hospital information systems, particularly around nursing diagnosis, planning, and documentation. Indonesian nurses are engaging in digital health, and more training is required for nursing students and qualified nurses to fully utilize digital health.",

The development after possible cerebrospinal fluid overdrainage and stretching of bridging veins facilitates the further expansion of the hematoma, thus provoking intracranial symptoms and often necessitates surgical treatment. However, in the case of complications, the incidence of SDH post-VPS insertion is not well documented, especially in Indonesia. We reported a case of a 59-year-old previously healthy Indonesian male with sudden right-side extremity weakness and dysarthria 2 months post-VPS procedure as the treatment for long-standing overt ventriculomegaly in adults. History of head trauma and oral anticoagulant consumption was denied. As his mental state deteriorated, he also presented with a high fever; therefore, suspicion of cerebritis was raised and was later confirmed to be subacute SDH after a second radiology scan, prompting further surgical intervention. Burr-hole drainage was done, and the patient was discharged from the hospital with a favorable outcome. This case demonstrated that subdural accumulation of the blood may occur following VPS insertion, most likely caused by a sudden pressure release following the procedure. The near-misdiagnosis of subacute SDH proves a challenging diagnosis in such an underreported case.",

Among the platforms, X (formerly Twitter) gives users the freedom of speech to express their subjects and topics. Hence, users express their opinions on every topic, from light-hearted to heavy topics such as politics and the economy. This vast opinion from users creates a valuable resource for research. This paper presents the Indonesian Stock Market Dataset for Sentiment Analysis (ID-SMSA), a collection of 3288 tweets discussing the top 10 largest market caps in the Indonesian stock market as of March 2023. The dataset is in Indonesian and an English translated version is provided, making it the first Indonesian-language dataset discussing the Indonesian stock market. Human annotators labelled each tweet as positive, neutral, or negative based on baseline annotation characteristics criteria created and reviewed by an expert in clinical psychology. A voting system determines which tweets to include in the dataset. This creates a consistent dataset that reflects clear and agreed-upon sentiments and removes ambiguous and contradictory data. The voted tweets include 2339 positive, 999 neutral, and 1025 negative sentiments. This dataset supports research into Indonesian stock market growth and the role of social media in financial discussions.",

      "abstract": "Despite entering the post-pandemic phase, SARS-CoV-2 remains a treatment challenge due to evolving mutations and immune evasion, leading to the emergence of antibody-resistant variants. This study aims to computationally construct a human Fv against various emerged variants of SARS-CoV-2 based on IgA sequences from Indonesian COVID-19 survivors. Survivor's saliva and plasma were purified using affinity chromatography to isolate anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA. The IgA components, heavy and light chains, were isolated using SDS-PAGE and confirmed by Western Blot. They were extracted, digested with trypsin and chymotrypsin, and sequenced using LC MS/MS. Full Fvs were constructed based on IgA sequence obtained and covered with database and reference sequences to generate an Fv Library. The selection of the Fv Library was performed based on modelling, developability, and molecular docking analysis against various RBD variants. The study identified 9 potential Fvs with strong binding affinities to RBD-SARS-CoV-2 across all variants with RMSD values of CDR and Framework of Fv model structures <0.5 Å and developability scores within the safe therapeutic range. FVIGA0289, one of the top candidates, had binding affinities (ΔG) of -17.5, -16.3, -15.6, -16.6, -17.4, and -17.6 kcal/mol for the Wuhan, alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and omicron (XBB.1.5) variants, respectively. In conclusion, the use of antibody information isolated from Indonesian patients has successfully facilitated the computational construction of IgA-based Fv candidates with strong binding to multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, supported by promising structural models and developability.",

PKBM development in Jambi City represented an active and critical effort to empower the community to improve skills and knowledge related to professions. The focus of PKBM was the management of an established and sustainable community education program. The method used in this research was the Context, Input, Process and Product (CIPP) evaluation model. The goals of PKBM had been following Indonesian education's goals and the pillars of education set by the United Nations, namely learning to know, learning to do, learning to be, and learning to live together. The curriculum used by PKBM referred to educational standards in Indonesia. Each PKBM was allowed to develop their particular programs, such as entrepreneurial programs. PKBM students were trained to be productive in life. The skills taught include farming, gardening, and making batik. Learning methods were done well and innovative. However, the pandemic disrupted the implementation of learning activities because there were no direct activities and practices. The evaluation carried out at PKBM consisted of a written test and product assessment.",

Over the past decade, the largest group of new HIV cases in Indonesia has been among women of reproductive age (15-49 years). This trend is largely driven by the widely held and fallacious belief that heterosexual, married women are not at risk of HIV. In this study we aim to challenge this misconception and investigate the complexity of HIV transmission, with a focus on HIV susceptibility among married women in Indonesia.",
